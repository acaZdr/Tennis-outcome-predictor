# Tennis Match Predictions

## Overview
This project aims to predict outcomes of tennis matches using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The Jupyter notebook, "Tennis - Predictions.ipynb," encompasses a comprehensive approach, from data preprocessing to model building and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes historical data of tennis matches. Key features include player statistics, match conditions, and historical performance. The data has undergone thorough preprocessing for cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction to ensure accurate model training.

## Methodology
The approach includes:
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset to understand patterns and correlations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Deriving new features that could impact match outcomes.
- **Model Selection**: Experimenting with various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Neural Networks etc.
- **Model Training and Testing**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model validation.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

## Results
The models provide insights into factors that significantly impact match outcomes. The best-performing model achieves an accuracy of 66.1%, indicating a strong predictive capability.

## Requirements
